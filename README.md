# DiscordCLI-Cpp
A simple discord bot CLI client made in C++


based on sleepydiscord: https://github.com/yourWaifu/sleepy-discord

# How to use
First, you change the [Your Token here] in main.cpp

Then you change the [Your bot name here] in headers/main.hpp

Then change [Your channel ID here] in headers/main.hpp

Then you build it like a normal Cmake app:

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

```
